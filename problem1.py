"""
Factoring simple trinomials
Create a user interface using tkinter.
There should be a label indicating instructions for what the user needs to do.
The program will factor a trinomial of the type ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b and c
are coefficients.  For the purposes of this program, a will always be 1.
The user should enter in coefficients for b and c.  Note that if you are factoring
a trinomial of the type ax^2 - bx + c, then b is just a negative number.
There should be a button to factor the trinomial
The program should display the factored form in an Entry widget.

Extension: make the + between a,b and b,c buttons that will toggle
between + and -.
