## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #009b Input and Output with TKinter (12 marks)

Objectives:
* Get input from a tkinter Entry widget using Entry.get()
* Put data into a tkinter entry widget using Entry.insert()
* Remove contents of an entry widget using Entry.delete()
* Update the contents of a label using textvariable instead of text
* Add an event to a button using the command option

A GUI is supposed to make input and output easier for the user, so
we had better learn how to send and receive data from some of the
widgets.

Today, we will be looking at creating our first event driven programs
that use the command option for button widgets.  This allows us to have
the program execute specific code when the button is clicked.

Some of the code that we will be executing today involves retrieving
data from an Entry widget and doing something with it.  This is how
our GUI will receive its input.  However, we will also need to produce
output, so we will be using the Entry.insert() and Entry.delete()
methods to help us update the contents of an Entry widget.

### 3 Tasks (8 points)

##### Task 1 (4 points)
Create entry widets to allow user to enter their:
* name
* student number
* grade
Create a button so that when they click on the button, it states all of the information in a 4th entry widget


##### Task 2
Create a window with 3 entry widgets and 1 button.
The first 2 entry widgets allow the user to enter in the 2 short sides of a right triangle.
When the button is clicked, calculate the length of the hypotenuse and display it in the 3rd entry widget.
Any labels you need for instruction are optional.
